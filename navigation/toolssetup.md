# Setting Up Tools 



# Installing WSL

When I was installing WSL I had no issues as the already provided guide to set up wsl was already good enough for me to fully install WSL. When I installed WSL i did NOT have it on the machene it was installed on so it did take some setting up and wating.


# Cloning And Setting Up Tools

When I set Up my tools via opencs and the student repo and venv, there were some missing steps on how to resolve conflicts but I figgured it out as I used last years setup guide to fill in the holes. One of the cmds that was not given (at the time of setup) was pip install -r requrments.txt and the order to run some cmds either int he venv or out. But besides small issues and having to re download WSL due to a mess up i did setting up tools went very smoothly.



# Installing dependencies
Some dependencies where never installed such as some extentions to run WSL in vscode and some other required ones. There were some errors when running mak that was fixed after re looking at the given documentation. BEsides these small bumps there where some other issues that I solved rather fast.
